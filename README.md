# A Simple Static Site Generator
## for learning/practice/experimentation
### probably for use for jmarq.github.io

yeah, a bunch of static site generators exist, and yeah, Jekyll can be used pretty seamlessly with github pages (I've done it in the past). I just want to back away from opinionated/prefab solutions and refamiliarize myself with the basics of static site generation.

## So what will be generated?

at the very least, an index page with a list of posts

individual pages for each post? 

hierarchical pages/directories? how to structure this?

## So maybe for the initial i'll just make an index page and individual pages for posts and keep the directory structure "flat"

that way I'll get moving on the basics before getting bogged down with hierarchy, pagination, etc. though, those will be interesting problems to consider down the road. I'm not opposed to a near-complete rewrite for a future version, since this is pretty much for learning and an excuse to put something new up on my github page, which has been stagnant recently.


## So, what sort of posts?

descriptions of github projects, links to repos/hosted versions. screenshots.

blog entries, links to interesting articles, what's on my "developer" mind, etc.
